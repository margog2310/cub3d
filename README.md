Cub3D is a simple 3D raycasting game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, developed as part of the 42 curriculum. Raycasting is a technique used to simulate a 3D perspective in a 2D environment by casting rays from the player's viewpoint and detecting where they intersect with walls. Cub3D utilizes the MiniLibX graphics library to render a dynamic maze-like environment, allowing players to navigate through a first-person perspective with smooth movement and collision detection.
