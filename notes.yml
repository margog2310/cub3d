map_parsing:
	starting:
		- main function runs 
		- check for 1 arg (map file) ✅
	parse:
		- check if the arg has a .cub extension 
		- check if map can be opened. ✅
	read_parse:
		- create_map:
				- allocate memory for map ✅
				- open file ✅
				- use gnl to read lines one by one ✅ (reads map file successfully)
				- check for textures and colors (NO, SO, EA, WE, F, C) ✅

=================================

RAYCASTING AND MOVEMENT:
TO_FIX:
	player_spawning:
		- player spawns in the wrong location...idk why 
	player_movement:
		- movement is fkinnn inverted...idk how to fix :(
		- rotation with arrow keys causes diagonal drift
		- player offset changes after using arrows, affecting WASD
		- WASD works fine before using arrows (though still inverted)
	player_coordinates:
		- only printing X coordinates
		- need to fix Y coordinate output
	mouse_click_coordinates:
		- only printing X coordinates
		- need to capture both X and Y coordinates
	raycasting:
		- minimap raycasting ✅
		- need to understand the difference between 2D and 3D raycasting
		- figure out how to calculate wall height
	textures:
		- need to start placing textures
		- ensure textures align correctly with raycasting calculations
